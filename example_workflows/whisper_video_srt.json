But it's, you know, ray reconstruction from the NVIDIA side,\n\n17\n00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:12,319\nor things like NRD, or any of the other larger scale denoisers also cover other aspects of\n\n18\n00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,599\nray tracing denoising, including like direct shadows, direct lighting, indirect diffuse\n\n19\n00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:25,479\nlighting. And with this implementation of ray regeneration here, in Black Ops 7, we're only\n\n20\n00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,879\nseeing reflections. So we're not actually getting a full picture.\n\n21\n00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,240\nRight. Okay. And on top of that, there's other stuff as well, for example, and I think that\n\n22\n00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:42,340\nreally sticks out to me here. On the same settings, the game can present differently on NVIDIA and AMD\n\n23\n00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,639\nGPUs, right?\n\n24\n00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:49,620\nI don't know what this is about. I've reinstalled drivers, both for AMD and NVIDIA here, because I\n\n25\n00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,819\ndon't know what I'm looking at necessarily. But just like, look at this scene here in the training\n\n26\n00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:54,099\nmap.\n\n27\n00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,460\nOkay.\n\n28\n00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,639\nI flip back and forth between them, and you'll see like, hey, wait, why is this like one image\n\n29\n00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:05,159\ndarker? Why is one lighter? And it has to do with like shadows, as well as some of the post-processing\n\n30\n00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,379\nreproduction. And if you like zoom in a corner, you'll see that the distance at which shadows\n\n31\n00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:13,680\nrenders at the same settings are actually different. And I don't know what's causing that.\n\n32\n00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:19,620\nThen, like in another scene here, you can see that the way shadows are rendered entirely is\n\n33\n00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,439\ndifferent. They have like, they're more opaque in some settings.\n\n34\n00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:31,199\nSo, you can see that the light is more intense on the AMD side, and they're darker on the NVIDIA side.\n\n35\n00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:37,840\nI don't know why this is the case, but we're not seeing the same one-to-one visuals here when I look at\n\n36\n00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,120\nthis game, as well as the ray tracing itself is different between the vendors. In this scene here, from\n\n37\n00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,479\nthat training map, you'll see that there are reflections of lights on the floor that just aren't there on\n\n38\n00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,419\nthe AMD side.\n\n39\n00:03:52,419 --> 00:04:02,020\nAnd another similar area of that map, once again, more missing lights on the AMD side, as well as the decals on the wall showing\n\n40\n00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,139\nlike lettering and whatnot for this cool little sci-fi area.\n\n41\n00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,039\nYeah, they're missing there too on the AMD side.\n\n42\n00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:13,199\nSo, we're not getting really one-to-one comparisons here as much as I would like.\n\n43\n00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:20,879\nSo, sometimes you'll see maybe differences in the comparisons I show, and it could be chalked up to differences in, or just buggy visuals in general.\n\n44\n00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,980\nLike, I just don't know.\n\n45\n00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,160\nRight.\n\n46\n00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:22,980\nYeah.\n\n47\n00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:23,800\nOkay.\n\n48\n00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,079\nYeah.\n\n49\n00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:29,740\nAnd there's other things as well, because, well, obviously, when you're looking at that kind of evidence, it kind of suggests that doing like-for-like\n\n50\n00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:35,500\nbenchmarks between NVIDIA and AMD is probably not a good idea because ultimately they're not rendering the same things.\n\n51\n00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:46,939\nBut let's talk more specifically about FSR ray regeneration, because, you know, going into this, it would be, well, you'd kind of think that ray\n\n52\n00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:52,120\nregeneration is essentially AMD's answer to DLSS ray reconstruction, right?\n\n53\n00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,160\nHowever, it's not quite that cut and dried, is it?\n\n54\n00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,019\nNo.\n\n55\n00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:04,759\nI think here, in a little way, it's a little bit like FSR 1.0 versus DLSS 2.0.\n\n56\n00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,300\nAnd I don't mean to say that as like a negative way.\n\n57\n00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,379\nRather, we're kind of looking at two different approaches.\n\n58\n00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:18,439\nI'm actually not sure if this is the nth degree goal of what AMD actually wants Redstone's ray regeneration tech to be.\n\n59\n00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,040\nAnd I think the way you can see that is if you just look in the menu.\n\n60\n00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,100\nYeah.\n\n61\n00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:27,399\nWith ray regeneration on, it doesn't require FSR 4.\n\n62\n00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:30,240\nIt's not, it doesn't require it at all.\n\n63\n00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,399\nYou can turn on FSR 3.\n\n64\n00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,879\nYou can turn on XCSS.\n\n65\n00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,600\nYou can turn on the game's TAA, I guess.\n\n66\n00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,240\nI only tried it with FSR 3.\n\n67\n00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:44,079\nAnd as you can see here, the two different, there's differences in image quality between these two versions.\n\n68\n00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,519\nRight.\n\n69\n00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,079\nRay regeneration with FSR 3, ray regeneration with FSR 4.\n\n70\n00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,040\nAnd this is actually very different than what NVIDIA does.\n\n71\n00:05:51,040 --> 00:06:03,879\nWhere when you turn on ray reconstruction, it turns on an entirely different and much heavier algorithm that combines the upscaling step with the denoising step.\n\n72\n00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,360\nAnd that has a number of advantages for performance as well as visuals.\n\n73\n00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:19,579\nAnd you can kind of see what I mean by that when you compare ray reconstruction on the NVIDIA side versus AMD for things that are highly mirror-like.\n\n74\n00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,519\nRight.\n\n75\n00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,459\nLike here on this puddle on the ground.\n\n76\n00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,899\nI want you to focus on like this one edge here that I've highlighted.\n\n77\n00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:33,180\nOn the ray regeneration side, you can see like the internal 1080p resolution here from 4K performance mode FSR 4 here.\n\n78\n00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:39,040\nVersus on the NVIDIA side, it's more like a straight anti-aliased 4K edge.\n\n79\n00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,660\nAnd that has some repercussions.\n\n80\n00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:49,560\nIt's a lot more like older denoising tech visually than it is like something that we expected from the NVIDIA side.\n\n82\n00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:51,480\nSo, it's a lot more like a ray reconstruction competitor.\n\n83\n00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:52,360\nOkay.\n\n84\n00:06:52,399 --> 00:07:03,620\nSo, just to sort of boil it down to a more sort of simple take, it's like ray reconstruction is not just a denoiser but also an upscaler for ray traced effects, right?\n\n85\n00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,079\nYes.\n\n86\n00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:10,139\nBecause obviously, if you don't have that upscaling effect, you've got like, you know, everything else is upscaled.\n\n87\n00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:16,379\nBut the reflections or whatever is being reconstructed with ray reconstruction would still be at a lower resolution.\n\n88\n00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:19,399\nSo, ray reconstruction is also upscaling.\n\n89\n00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:32,300\nBut what we're seeing here with FSR 4 ray regeneration, it doesn't seem to be that upscaling step, which kind of explains why it seems to be operating also as an option with FSR 3 or TAA or XESS, right?\n\n90\n00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:32,800\nYeah.\n\n91\n00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:47,819\nAnd a really good example that you can find, and I saw Daniel Owen pointed this out as well too, and so did Computerbase, is that the reflections on water look very different between ray reconstruction at the same resolution as ray regeneration.\n\n92\n00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,560\nAnd like you can see in this example here.\n\n93\n00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,540\nIt just like, they look a lot softer and lower res.\n\n94\n00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:59,019\nAnd I saw some speculation online like, oh, is one representing water more realistically than the other?\n\n95\n00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:00,120\nAnd the answer is no.\n\n96\n00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:07,000\nRay regeneration doesn't appear to be doing the upscaling of the ray tracing effect like ray reconstruction does.\n\n97\n00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:17,540\nYou can see that difference if you turn up ray regeneration's internal resolution to native, for example, 4K FSR 4 native resolution, and you put them all side by side.\n\n98\n00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:26,379\nLeft 4K performance mode FSR 4, in the middle 4K FSR 4 native, and then ray reconstruction at internal 1080p there.\n\n99\n00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:36,820\nAnd you'll see that the 4K native version of ray regeneration looks a lot closer in sharpness, much like DLSS 4 ray reconstruction.\n\n100\n00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:47,440\nAnd I think that's what we're seeing here is this, it's actually doing a lot of the work when the output is still like at the internal resolution that it's actually rendering.\n\n101\n00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,340\nAt 1080p.\n\n102\n00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:57,059\nSo when I'm preparing here, it almost feels a little unfair because I don't think these technologies are actually doing the same thing, which is really strange.\n\n103\n00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:57,940\nOkay.\n\n104\n00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:04,840\nSo I'm kind of reminded of the debut of FSR 3 frame generation here, where we had like what you might call a proof of concept.\n\n105\n00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,419\nIt worked.\n\n106\n00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,379\nIt was integrated into a couple of games in that case.\n\n107\n00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:10,720\nBut it wasn't the final thing, right?\n\n108\n00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:14,019\nIt wasn't the technology that we have today.\n\n109\n00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,580\nIt was a preview of sorts even.\n\n110\n00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,299\nWith certain limitations.\n\n111\n00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:17,419\nRight.\n\n112\n00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:17,759\nWith certain conditions.\n\n113\n00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,360\nNow, we don't actually know whether that's the case here because we haven't really had a huge amount of messaging from AMD.\n\n114\n00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,399\nBut it does kind of feel like a work in progress rendition, right?\n\n115\n00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:27,960\nYeah.\n\n116\n00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:32,919\nThere's a couple things that give me that feeling from the visual feature set.\n\n117\n00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:43,159\nNow, one thing that reflections do on semi-glossy surfaces or rougher reflections, as you call them, is that when you look at the bottom of the reflection where it meets the object, it's very sharp.\n\n118\n00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:45,679\nAnd then it starts to get more diffuse as you look along.\n\n119\n00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,340\nThe edge of the reflection as it goes away from the object that it's reflecting.\n\n120\n00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,259\nAnd that's something that seems to be missing in ray regeneration.\n\n121\n00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,320\nAnd that's a typical feature of reflections that is reconstructed in the denoising step.\n\n122\n00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,440\nThat's like there's so much noise that you have to kind of reconstruct that effect of reflections.\n\n123\n00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,120\nAnd that's missing in ray regen in a number of areas that I've looked in.\n\n124\n00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,840\nLike, for example, here on the floor.\n\n125\n00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,659\nYou can see that on the right.\n\n126\n00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:18,000\nOn the ray reconstruction side, it starts off really sharp.\n\n127\n00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,360\nAnd then it gets tapered at the end and more diffuse.\n\n128\n00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,639\nWhereas on the ray regeneration side, it stays sharp the entire length of the reflection.\n\n129\n00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:41,700\nAnd the same goes in the other direction where if a surface is very, has a very rough reflection on the AMD ray regeneration side, it's entirely rough no matter how close it is to the object like we see here.\n\n130\n00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,340\nNext to this trash can.\n\n131\n00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:43,899\nWoohoo.\n\n132\n00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:44,639\nTrash can.\n\n133\n00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,399\nAnd I love DF.\n\n134\n00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,379\nWe talk about ray traced toilets and trash cans.\n\n135\n00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,240\nThis is our job.\n\n136\n00:10:50,639 --> 00:11:00,519\nBut, yeah, you look here and you can see that it's like entirely blurry, the entire length of the reflection versus on the ray reconstruction side where it has that contact hardening effect that you expect.\n\n137\n00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:13,220\nSo missing stuff like that in combination with the fact that it doesn't appear to be a combination upscaler denoiser makes me think this is not a complete product.\n\n138\n00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:13,879\nYeah.\n\n139\n00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,279\nDid you want to talk a bit about quality and performance here?\n\n140\n00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:19,659\nBecause there's some points we need to go through there, right?\n\n141\n00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,519\nYeah, sure.\n\n142\n00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:25,940\nSo there's some stuff that I think will change over time with this.\n\n143\n00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:36,600\nOne thing that I want to point out that it does really well at the moment is moving objects and reflections as well as animated billboards and reflections.\n\n144\n00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,259\nThis training level has a number of sci-fi billboards in them.\n\n145\n00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,860\nAnd there's some very, like, either.\n\n147\n00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,360\nWater reflections on the ground or just very reflective surfaces like metal floors.\n\n148\n00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:51,720\nAnd in them you can see the reflections of these billboards in them.\n\n149\n00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,539\nOn the ray reconstruction side, they're much higher res looking.\n\n150\n00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:57,080\nThat's because I think that's the way it is.\n\n151\n00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:07,159\nBut you'll notice that the detail in the reflection will have ghosty areas where the detail resolves over multiple frames incorrectly.\n\n152\n00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,200\nWhereas on the ray regeneration side, in spite of it being lower res, it's holding it at least.\n\n153\n00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,919\nWithout the ghosting.\n\n154\n00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,139\nAnd that looks quite a bit better, I would say, for that aspect.\n\n155\n00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,240\nAnd it does that really well.\n\n156\n00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:26,080\nAnother thing that it does quite a bit better is some moving objects and reflections on, like, more glossy surfaces.\n\n157\n00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,220\nYou can see, like, here.\n\n158\n00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:32,000\nThere's this weird rotating dial in the middle of the map.\n\n159\n00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:43,179\nAnd one of those rotating features of it, when you look at its reflection on the ground, you'll see in the ray regeneration side versus ray reconstruction that it holds its silhouette back.\n\n160\n00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,899\nAnd it doesn't blur it or ghost it away a bit.\n\n161\n00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:48,120\nAnd that's something that it does really, really well.\n\n162\n00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:52,320\nSo it's holding, it's handling motion quite a bit well for those things.\n\n163\n00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,519\nBut at the same time, some other motion aspects are not as good.\n\n164\n00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,740\nFor example, disocclusion.\n\n165\n00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:13,159\nLike, you can see that on the water in the training map where when you move your gun out of the way, on the ray regeneration side, it shows, like, the silhouette of the gun in, like, a blurry detail form there for quite a number of frames after the gun's moved away.\n\n166\n00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,720\nSo it does movement pretty okay.\n\n167\n00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:21,500\nBut disocclusion seems to be very work in progress at the moment, to say the least.\n\n168\n00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:21,720\nOkay.\n\n169\n00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,100\nPerformance, frame rates.\n\n170\n00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:28,700\nThere's obviously a computational hit to ray regeneration, right?\n\n171\n00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:29,980\nYeah.\n\n172\n00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,340\nAnd also, no.\n\n173\n00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,620\nAnd I'm not the only one who's measured this.\n\n174\n00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,519\nI looked at computer-based to double-check to see I wasn't going crazy.\n\n175\n00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:43,139\nBut if you look at the game's benchmark and turn off ray regeneration and the game's base detail form, you'll see that it's not that bad.\n\n176\n00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:43,419\nIt's just that it's not as good as the game's base denoiser.\n\n177\n00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:52,700\nLike, you compare the two in terms of performance, you'll see that ray regeneration costs more or less the exact same as the game's base denoiser.\n\n178\n00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:57,539\nIt's about one frame per second difference between these two benchmark runs.\n\n179\n00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,399\nAnd I ran it, like, three or four times.\n\n180\n00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:03,679\nSo the average cost is the same as the game's base denoiser more or less.\n\n181\n00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:13,080\nAnd the weird thing, too, is I also checked out whether or not turning on FSR4 with ray regeneration would have a different performance.\n\n183\n00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,120\nAnd I found that it ran more or less the same, too.\n\n184\n00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,940\nWhich is interesting.\n\n185\n00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:27,720\nI guess that points to some other bottlenecking occurring in the architecture that is keeping the performance much the same.\n\n186\n00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:37,340\nBut once again, computer-based also found at the resolutions they tested that the performance between the denoiser and ray regeneration was more or less the exact same.\n\n187\n00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,360\nSo I'm not alone.\n\n188\n00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,720\nInteresting.\n\n189\n00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,559\nYeah.\n\n190\n00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,100\nWell, you would kind of hope that machine learning-based denoiser would be the same as the game's base denoiser.\n\n193\n00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:48,759\nBut I think that the game's base denoiser would be, like, you know, as performant as the basic one that's of a lower quality, right?\n\n194\n00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:49,200\nYeah.\n\n195\n00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,519\nIn that case, that is a job well done.\n\n196\n00:14:52,600 --> 00:15:06,620\nAnd you'd want to keep them within the same amount so that you at least when the quality improves over time with, like, different network weights and whatnot and just better training, that you get a much better image for this relatively similar cost.\n\n197\n00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:13,080\nWhich is the nth-degree goal for this project, I assume, after they get past this initial almost beta-looking phase of it.\n\n198\n00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,940\nOkay.\n\n199\n00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:14,440\nRight.\n\n200\n00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:14,879\nFair enough.\n\n201\n00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,799\nAny final thoughts before we wrap up?\n\n202\n00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,639\nYeah.\n\n203\n00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,340\nI think this is altogether a very strange way to demo this exciting new technology.\n\n204\n00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,019\nIt's going to be part of the next PlayStation, probably part of the next Xbox.\n\n205\n00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:34,399\nAnd the way it's kind of pushed out on PC right now seems like it was pushed out when it wasn't ready yet.\n\n206\n00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:41,480\nAnd perhaps before even internally the engineering team might have said, oh, yeah, it's, like, feature complete.\n\n207\n00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,059\nBecause a lot of the stuff is already there.\n\n208\n00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,159\nAnd a lot of the stuff here doesn't seem like it's feature complete, like the lack of contact hardening and whatnot.\n\n209\n00:15:49,099 --> 00:16:01,100\nAlso being pushed as a part of, like, multiplayer-only Call of Duty on top of, like, the visual bugs in the generic Call of Duty graphics between vendors makes me think that this entire thing is a bit questionable.\n\n210\n00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:08,519\nLike, I'm not sure if the things I'm seeing are bugs or just the state of the product as it is right now.\n\n211\n00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,019\nSo that's always not a good thing.\n\n212\n00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:20,820\nI also maybe would have loved a little bit more internal information from an AMD and, like, a blog post about how it works and what to expect of the technology.\n\n213\n00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:26,720\nBut at the moment, it's just mainly what you see visually on screen and then doing the comparisons by yourself.\n\n214\n00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,480\nSo, yeah.\n\n215\n00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,000\nGeneral puzzlement, really, isn't it?\n\n216\n00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,159\nYeah.\n\n217\n00:16:32,939 --> 00:16:37,559\nI didn't know what to make of it when it launched because I only heard about it via a tweet.\n\n218\n00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,940\nAnd I was like, what?\n\n219\n00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:39,379\nWhat?\n\n220\n00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:44,940\nThis game has ray tracing and it has the first part of FSR Redstone?\n\n221\n00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:47,000\nAnd lo and behold, it did.\n\n222\n00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,919\nBut I didn't really know about that until, like, quite late.\n\n223\n00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,639\nSo that's the way it is.\n\n224\n00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,679\nIt's very, very strange.\n\n225\n00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,659\nIt's a bit of a bizarre product debut.\n\n226\n00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,139\nBut there it is.\n\n227\n00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,879\nAnd I guess we're not going to be doing huge, more in-depth testing on this because, well, two reasons.\n\n228\n00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,920\nFirst of all, it doesn't seem to be the final product.\n\n229\n00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,380\nAnd secondly, we can't, basically.\n\n230\n00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,160\nNo.\n\n231\n00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,779\nThere's a lot of bizarre stuff happening here.\n\n232\n00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,160\nThe fact that you can't use it in the campaign is just kind of baffling.\n\n233\n00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,460\nI'm wondering if it's an art issue or something like that.\n\n234\n00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:21,039\nBut, yeah, just general strangeness.\n\n235\n00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:31,819\nBut I guess we're just going to have to wait and see what further FSR Redstone disclosures will happen and new game integrations to actually get a better feel for what AMD is trying to achieve here.\n\n236\n00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:32,940\nYeah.\n\n237\n00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:38,440\nI think if it comes to more games as well as coming to, like, more path tracing titles,\n\n238\n00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:44,279\nwhere we can see more of its performance for other aspects of image lighting, then we'll have a better understanding of it.\n\n239\n00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:51,960\nAnd just like, you know, DLSS Ray Reconstruction, when the original 3.5 version came out, we talked about how it had, like, this smudgy ghosting look.\n\n240\n00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,599\nThat improved over time with other versions as well as the change over to Transformer model.\n\n241\n00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,039\nI think we're going to see a very similar trajectory with Ray Regeneration when the time comes.\n\n242\n00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,000\nOkay.\n\n243\n00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:02,519\nGood stuff.\n\n244\n00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,759\nWell, that's all we've got for this one.\n\n245\n00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,339\nBut if you enjoyed the content, please do like, subscribe, share, ring bells for notifications for
